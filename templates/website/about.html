        This web page is a part of a semester project where the assignment is to create a reactive system using a
        Raspberry Pi and at least two other components.<br/> The purpose of this project is that a student who sits at the study hall should be able to check if there
        is coffee in the coffee-can without leaving his seat.<br> This is done by having a weight which registers how
        much coffee is left in the can in percentage. This information is then sent to the webpage.<br> A student can also
        subscribe to being alerted via mail when a new coffee can has been brewed.<br> Don't worry, you will be unsubscribed automatic after a while(loop).
        There is also a highscore-list over the brewers <br>who has brewed the most.
